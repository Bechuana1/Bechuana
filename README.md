## LESSON 2
# Control statements
- 	Conditional Statements: Explain if, else if, and else for making decisions, with real-world examples like age validation or login scenarios.
- Loops: Introduce for, while, and do-while loops for repetition, demonstrating counting, iterating through arrays, and simulating simple games.
-	Switch Statements: Present switch statements as an alternative for multi-way branching, illustrating use cases like day-of-week calculations or menu options
# Functions
 -	Defining Functions: Explain function creation with function keyword, arguments (optional), return values, and calling functions.
-  Scope & Lifetime: Discuss variable scope (local vs. global) and function lifetime, demonstrating potential issues and best practices.
-  ecursion: Briefly introduce recursion (functions calling themselves) for specific tasks like calculating factorials or implementing tree traversal, but emphasize its use cautiously due to potential complexity.
# Arrays 
- Creating & Accessing Arrays: Explain array creation using array(), accessing elements using numeric and associative indexes, and basic operations like adding, removing, and modifying elements
- Looping through Arrays: Demonstrate using foreach, for, and while loops to iterate over arrays for processing data (e.g., calculating averages, searching for elements).
- 	Multidimensional Arrays: Introduce multidimensional arrays for structured data (e.g., tables, matrices), demonstrating how to create, access, and iterate through them.
- 	Array Functions: Explore built-in functions like count, sort, in_array, array_merge, and others for common array operations, emphasizing their usefulness in data manipulation.
# Forms & User Input
- HTML Forms: Briefly review HTML form elements (e.g., <input>, <select>, <textarea>) for user input and explain how to structure forms for sending data to a PHP script.
- 	Receiving Form Data: Demonstrate accessing form data using the $_POST or $_GET superglobals, depending on the form submission method.
- 	Form Validation & Sanitization: Emphasize the importance of validating user input to prevent security vulnerabilities (e.g., using filter_var, htmlspecialchars, regular expressions) and sanitizing data before processing it.
- 	Processing Form Data: Show how to process submitted data (e.g., calculate totals, store data in a database, send emails), demonstrating data manipulation techniques.
